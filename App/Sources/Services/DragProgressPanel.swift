/// `ProgressView`'s bar (and every other control) in a dimmed gray, not the
/// real accent color, in any window that isn't key — matching how Extract's
/// own sheet looks means this panel has to actually become key too. This
/// only runs after `writePromiseTo` starts, i.e. after the drop already
/// landed and the drag gesture itself is over — the mouse isn't held over
/// Finder anymore at that point, so activating here doesn't interrupt
